I will start by examining the source code of `ProductController` and `HelloService` in the `sample-projects/demo-app` directory, and then I'll check the content of the corrupted test files to see if any valid code remains.

I will read the source files `HelloService.java` and `ProductController.java` to understand their logic, and then I will examine the corrupted test files `HelloServiceTest.java` and `ProductControllerTest.java` to see if any valid code can be salvaged.

I will now read the `ProductService.java`, `ProductCreateRequest.java`, and `ProductResponse.java` files to understand their structure and dependencies, which will help me write a comprehensive test for `ProductController`.

I will read the `ProductCreateRequest.java`, `ProductResponse.java`, and `ProductService.java` files to understand their contents.
