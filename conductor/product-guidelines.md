# Product Guidelines

## Core Principles
The following principles guide the development of the Test-Hae-Llama project:

- **Autonomy and Self-Healing:** The primary goal is to create an autonomous test generation suite. The system should be capable of not only generating tests but also verifying them and repairing them when they fail.
- **Security First:** All development must adhere to the Llama Security Protocol (LSP). This includes masking sensitive information and ensuring the AI engine operates in a sandboxed environment with no direct file access.

## Prose Style and Documentation
All generated documentation and code comments should adhere to a professional and technical prose style. The focus should be on clarity, conciseness, and technical accuracy.
